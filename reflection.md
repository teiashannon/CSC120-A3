I did not consult with any classmates on this assignment, nor did I pair program to complete any of this work. I attended Sunday night's TA hours but unfortunately was unable to get any help due to the volume of students present with only one TA there. My initial impressions of Java are that it is not as intuitive to me as Python felt, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. The documentation and StackOverflow are definitely helping me. Honestly, trying a bunch of techniques and ideas was what helped me. Literal trial and error. Getting various errors was sort of like getting clues which helped me to figure out the root of the problem with each attempt and find my way to the solution. However, despite many hours of work I could not get the canned responses and mirrored phrases to print separately (that is, if a canned response was given I could not figure out how to stop the original phrase from being printed, and if a mirrored response was given I could not figure out how to stop the canned phase from being printed).
